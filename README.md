SNHU Portfolio 

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Starter code was given for a treasure hunt game in which a pirate finds its way to the treasure on an 8x8 grid. I was tasked with creating the Q learning code to train the model. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems and innovate creative ways to do so. It matters because the world is full of complex problems to solve and needs a scientific mind to do so reliably and creatively speaking. Without computer scientists and innovative minds, we'd be sitting in a quite boring world with a pile of problems that couldn't be solved. Every day scientists work hard to solve issues surrounding the real world and every day people, as well as outside the real world and into space and time. 



How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by first examining thoroughly. I like to have a good background on a problem and ask myself the same set of questions for most CS problems. What, where, when, why, how, and who questions usually give a good enough background to fully understand. It makes me upset when people jump to a "just do <insert generic answer>" before they have a full understanding of what the actual issue is. It's more important to me that I listen to the issue and fully understand instead of being the first to jump to the most obvious solution. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities are plain and simple. I am responsible to provide privacy, security, and a quality product to the user and the organization. In this, I work responsibly and within the bounds of using standard/conventional code. I avoid perceived and real conflicts of interest and hold public wealth, health and safety in high regard. I am responsible to treating all people with kindness, honesty, and respect and to review my work honestly and accept mistakes or criticism and correct any errors.
